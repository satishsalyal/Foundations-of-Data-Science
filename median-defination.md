# 🧮 Median Formula 

The **median** represents the middle value of an ordered dataset. It separates the higher half from the lower half of a data sample, population, or probability distribution.

---

## 📘 Formula Overview

The formula to calculate the median depends on whether the number of observations is **odd** or **even**.

### 🔹 Odd Number of Observations

If the total number of observations (**n**) is **odd**, the median is given by:

$\[ \text{Median} = \left( \frac{n + 1}{2} \right)^{th} \text{term} \]$

where *n* is the total number of observations.

### 🔹 Even Number of Observations

If the total number of observations (**n**) is **even**, the median is given by:

\[ \text{Median} = \frac{\left( \frac{n}{2} \right)^{th} \text{term} + \left( \frac{n}{2} + 1 \right)^{th} \text{term}}{2} \]

where *n* is the total number of observations.

## 🧠 How to Calculate the Median

1. Arrange all numbers in **ascending order**.  
2. Identify the **middle value(s)**.  
3. Apply the appropriate formula depending on whether *n* is even or odd.

## ✏️ Examples

### **Example 1**
**Find the Median of:** 14, 63, and 55  

➡️ Arrange in ascending order: **14, 55, 63**  
✅ **Median = 55**

---

### **Example 2**
**Find the Median of:**  
4, 17, 77, 25, 22, 23, 92, 82, 40, 24, 14, 12, 67, 23, 29  

➡️ Arrange in ascending order:  
**4, 12, 14, 17, 22, 23, 23, 24, 25, 29, 40, 67, 77, 82, 92**  

There are **15** observations (odd).  
✅ **Median = 8th term = 24**

---

### **Example 3**
**Rahul’s Family Gasoline Prices:**  
1.79, 1.61, 2.09, 1.84, 1.96, 2.11, 1.75  

➡️ Arrange in ascending order:  
**1.61, 1.75, 1.79, 1.84, 1.96, 2.09, 2.11**  

There are **7** observations (odd).  
✅ **Median = 4th term = 1.84**

## 📊 Median in Statistics

The **median** is the central value that divides a dataset into two equal halves. It’s especially useful when the data contains outliers, as it’s **less affected by extreme values** than the mean.

### Example

- Median of **3, 3, 5, 9, 11** = **5**  
- Median of **3, 5, 7, 9** = \( \frac{5 + 7}{2} = 6 \)

### 🧩 Summary Table

| Case | Formula | Example | Result |
|------|----------|----------|---------|
| Odd n | \( (n+1)/2^{th} \) term | 15 values → 8th term | 24 |
| Even n | \( (n/2^{th} + (n/2 + 1)^{th}) / 2 \) | 6 values → (3rd + 4th)/2 | Average of middle two |

> 💡 **Tip:** Always ensure your data is sorted before applying the formula!  
> The median provides a robust measure of central tendency, especially for skewed datasets.
