# 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), introduced by **John Tukey**, is a critical step in understanding datasets.  
It allows data scientists to:  

- ✔️ Explore and summarize data
- ✔️ Identify obvious errors
- ✔️ Understand patterns within the data
- ✔️ Validate assumptions before model building 
- ✔️ find interesting relations among the variables
- ✔️ Apply transformations when needed  

EDA is all about **discovering the hidden story behind data** 🕵️‍♂️.

## 📌 Why is EDA Important in Data Science?

EDA provides critical insights before formal modeling or hypothesis testing. It:

- Helps uncover hidden patterns and trends.
- Detects outliers or anomalous events.
- Validates assumptions about the data.
- Ensures data quality and acuracy.
- Assists stakeholders in refining their business questions.

Ultimately, EDA strengthens the reliability of analytical results, making them more applicable to business objectives and decision-making. Once insights are gained, the findings can be leveraged for advanced statistical analysis or machine learning applications.

## 🔎 Types of Exploratory Data Analysis  

There are four primary types of EDA:

1. Univariate non-graphical
2. Univariate graphical
3. Multivariate non-graphical
4. Multivariate graphical

### 1️⃣ Univariate Non-Graphical Analysis  
Focuses on a **single variable** to understand its distribution.  

**Key Descriptors:**  
- **Central Tendency:** Mean, Median, Mode  
- **Spread:** Variance, Standard Deviation  
- **Skewness & Kurtosis:** Measures of shape (asymmetry & peakedness)  

💡 *Example:* Using mean & median to summarize exam scores.

### 2️⃣ Univariate Graphical Analysis  
Uses visuals 📈 to provide deeper insights into single-variable data.  

**Common Techniques:**  
- 📊 **Histogram** → Shows frequency distribution  
- 🌿 **Stem-and-Leaf Plot** → Retains raw data values  
- 📦 **Boxplot** → Highlights spread, symmetry & outliers  
- 📐 **QQ Plot** → Tests data distribution against a theoretical model  

💡 *Example:* A histogram of customers’ ages in a retail store.  

---

### 3️⃣  Multivariate Non-Graphical Analysis  
Explores **relationships between two or more variables** using numbers and tables.  

- **Cross-tabulation:** Two-way tables for categorical data  
- **Comparative statistics:** Compare means/medians across groups (ANOVA-like approaches)  

💡 *Example:* Comparing average sales across different regions. 

---

### 4️⃣ Multivariate Graphical Analysis  
Represents relationships between **two or more variables** visually.  

**Popular Methods:**  
- 🔵 **Scatterplot** → Relationship between two quantitative variables  
- 📈 **Run Chart** → Data over time  
- 🎨 **Heatmap** → Color-coded variable values  
- 🫧 **Bubble Chart** → Adds bubble size as a third variable  
- 📊 **Multivariate Chart** → Displays interactions between multiple factors  

💡 *Example:* Scatterplot of income vs. expenditure.

## 🛠️ Tools for Exploratory Data Analysis  

Several programming languages and libraries simplify EDA:  

1. **R**  🟢 Python: An interpreted, object-oriented programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level, built-in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for rapid application development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python and EDA can be used together to identify missing values in a data set, which is important so you can decide how to handle missing values for machine learning.

## ✅ Conclusion  

EDA is the **foundation of every data science project**.  
It helps you:  

- Detect anomalies  
- Understand variable distributions  
- Explore relationships  
- Prepare data for modeling  

🔑 **Always perform EDA before jumping into modeling** – it ensures your data is clean, reliable, and ready for analysis.
