# Definition of Mean 

Mean is also said to be arithmetic mean. The meaning of mean is to evaluate the average. It is defined as the average of the given numbers. Mean is the sum of all the given data values divided by the total number of data values given in the set. It is given by:

**Mean = Sum of Observations / Total number of observations**

In the case of median and mode, median refers to the middle value of the data set, whereas mode refers to the repeated numbers in the data set.

## How to Find Mean

To calculate the mean value of the given data, it includes two steps. They are:

1. Add all the values in the data set  
2. After adding, divide that value by the total number of data given

## Mean Formula

According to the definition of mean, the formula to calculate the mean is given by:

**Mean = Sum of Given Data / Total Number of Data**

In terms of Sigma (∑) notation, the mean formula is:

```
Mean (x̄) = (Σ Xi) / N
```

Where:

- **N** = Total number of given data  
- **Σ Xi** = Sum of given data values

## Types of Mean

The three different types of mean are:

- Arithmetic Mean (AM)  
- Harmonic Mean (HM)  
- Geometric Mean (GM)

## Mean Example

**Question:**  
Find the mean for the given data set: 2, 6, 4, 5, 8  

**Solution:**  
Given data set = 2, 6, 4, 5, 8  

Total number of data value = 5  

Therefore, the formula to find the mean is given by:

```
Mean = Sum of given data / Total number of the data
     = (2 + 6 + 4 + 5 + 8) / 5
     = 25 / 5
     = 5
```

## Mean for Ungrouped Data

The example given below will help you in understanding how to find the mean of ungrouped data.

**Example:**  

In a class there are 20 students and they have secured a percentage of 88, 82, 88, 85, 84, 80, 81, 82, 83, 85, 84, 74, 75, 76, 89, 90, 89, 80, 82, and 83.

Find the mean percentage obtained by the class.

**Solution:**

```
Mean = Total of percentage obtained by 20 students in class / Total number of students
     = [88 + 82 + 88 + 85 + 84 + 80 + 81 + 82 + 83 + 85 + 84 + 74 + 75 + 76 + 89 + 90 + 89 + 80 + 82 + 83] / 20
     = 1660 / 20
     = 83
```

Hence, the mean percentage of each student in the class is **83%**.

## Mean for Grouped Data

For grouped data, we can find the mean using either of the following formulas.

### Direct method:
```
Mean = Σ(fixi) / Σ(fi)
```

### Assumed mean method:
```
Mean = A + (Σ(fi * di)) / Σ(fi)
```

### Step-deviation method:
```
Mean = A + [(Σ(fi * ui)) / Σ(fi)] * h
```

---

### Example:

Find the mean for the following distribution.

| xi | 11 | 14 | 17 | 20 |
|----|----|----|----|----|
| fi | 3  | 6  | 8  | 7  |

**Solution:**

For the given data, we can find the mean using the direct method.

| xi | fi | fixi |
|----|----|------|
| 11 | 3  | 33   |
| 14 | 6  | 84   |
| 17 | 8  | 136  |
| 20 | 7  | 140  |
| **Σfi = 24** | **Σfixi = 393** |   |

```
Mean = Σfixi / Σfi = 393 / 24 = 16.4
```

## Types of Mean

There are majorly three different types of mean value that you will be studying in statistics:

- Arithmetic Mean  
- Geometric Mean  
- Harmonic Mean  

---

### Arithmetic Mean

When you add up all the values and divide by the number of values it is called Arithmetic Mean. To calculate, just add up all the given numbers then divide by how many numbers are given.

**Example:**  
What is the mean of 3, 5, 9, 5, 7, 2?

```
3 + 5 + 9 + 5 + 7 + 2 = 31
Mean = 31 / 6 = 5.16
```

**Answer:** 5.16

---

### Geometric Mean

The geometric mean of two numbers **x** and **y** is:

```
√(x * y)
```

If you have three numbers **x**, **y**, and **z**, their geometric mean is:

```
³√(x * y * z)
```

**Example:**  
Find the geometric mean of 4 and 3?

```
√(4 * 3) = √12 = 3.46
```

---

### Harmonic Mean

The harmonic mean is used to average ratios.  

For two numbers **x** and **y**, the harmonic mean is:

```
HM = 2xy / (x + y)
```

For three numbers **x**, **y**, and **z**, the harmonic mean is:

```
HM = 3xyz / (xy + xz + yz)
```
