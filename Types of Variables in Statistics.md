# 📊 Lecture: Types of Variables in Statistics

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
By the end of this lecture, students will be able to:
- Understand the concept of variables in statistics.  
- Differentiate between **qualitative** and **quantitative** variables.  
- Identify and classify **discrete** and **continuous** variables.  
- Recognize **independent** and **dependent** variables in research.  
- Apply examples from real-life data to each type.

## 🧩 1. Introduction: What is a Variable?

In statistics, a **variable** is any **characteristic, number, or quantity** that can be measured or counted.  
It can take on **different values** for different individuals or observations.

### 🔹 Examples:
- Height of students  
- Gender of respondents  
- Number of cars owned  
- Income of families  

> 💡 In simple terms:  
> A variable is something that **varies** from one person or object to another.

## 🧮 2. Broad Classification of Variables

Variables are broadly classified into two main types:

| **Category** | **Type of Variable** | **Examples** |
|---------------|----------------------|---------------|
| **Qualitative (Categorical)** | Nominal, Ordinal | Gender, Blood group, Education level |
| **Quantitative (Numerical)** | Discrete, Continuous | Age, Height, Weight, Number of students |

---

## 🧠 3. Qualitative (Categorical) Variables

### 📘 Definition
A **qualitative variable** describes a **quality or attribute** of a person or object.  
Its values are **non-numerical** and represent categories or groups.

### 🔹 Subtypes of Qualitative Variables
#### a) Nominal Variables
- Represent categories **without any order or ranking**.
- Used to label distinct groups.

**Examples:**
- Gender → {Male, Female, Other}  
- Blood Group → {A, B, AB, O}  
- Marital Status → {Single, Married, Divorced}

> 💡 *You can name or label them, but not rank them.*

#### b) Ordinal Variables
- Represent categories **with a meaningful order**, but **the intervals between them are not equal**.
  
**Examples:**
- Education Level → {Primary, Secondary, Graduate, Postgraduate}  
- Satisfaction Rating → {Poor, Fair, Good, Excellent}  
- Socioeconomic Class → {Low, Middle, High}

> 💡 *You can rank them, but cannot measure the exact difference.*

## 📏 4. Quantitative (Numerical) Variables

### 📘 Definition
A **quantitative variable** represents **numeric data** that can be measured or counted.  
Its values are numbers on which arithmetic operations can be performed.

### 🔹 Subtypes of Quantitative Variables
#### a) Discrete Variables
- Take **countable values** (whole numbers).  
- Represent items that can be **counted**, not measured.

**Examples:**
- Number of students in a class → 40, 41, 42  
- Number of cars owned → 0, 1, 2, 3  
- Number of children in a family → 2, 3, 4  

> 💡 *Discrete variables cannot take fractional values.*

#### b) Continuous Variables
- Take **measurable values** that can include **fractions or decimals**.  
- Can assume **any value within a range**.

**Examples:**
- Height → 165.4 cm, 170.2 cm  
- Weight → 55.5 kg, 60.8 kg  
- Temperature → 36.5°C, 37.1°C  

> 💡 *Continuous variables can take infinite possible values within a range.*

## 📊 5. Another Classification: Independent vs Dependent Variables

In statistical experiments or research, we often deal with **cause-and-effect** relationships.

| **Type** | **Description** | **Example** |
|-----------|----------------|--------------|
| **Independent Variable (IV)** | The variable that is **manipulated or controlled** by the researcher. | Amount of fertilizer applied to crops |
| **Dependent Variable (DV)** | The variable that is **measured or observed** to assess the effect of IV. | Crop yield in kilograms |

### 📘 Example:
A researcher studies how study time affects exam scores.

- **Independent Variable (IV):** Study time (hours)  
- **Dependent Variable (DV):** Exam score (marks)

> 💡 *The dependent variable depends on the independent variable.*

## 🔢 6. Summary of Variable Types

| **Main Type** | **Subtype** | **Nature** | **Example** |
|----------------|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| **Qualitative** | Nominal | Non-numeric, no order | Gender (Male/Female) |
|  | Ordinal | Non-numeric, ordered | Satisfaction (Good/Better/Best) |
| **Quantitative** | Discrete | Numeric, countable | Number of students |
|  | Continuous | Numeric, measurable | Height, Weight |
| **Experimental** | Independent | Controlled variable | Study time |
|  | Dependent | Observed variable | Exam score |

## 📘 7. Examples from Real-Life Scenarios

| **Scenario** | **Variable** | **Type** |
|---------------|--------------|----------|
| Hospital records | Blood group | Nominal |
| School data | Class rank | Ordinal |
| Survey on transport | Number of cars | Discrete |
| Weather report | Temperature | Continuous |
| Education research | Study hours | Independent |
| Education research | Marks obtained | Dependent |

## 🧰 9. Practice Exercises

1. Identify the type of variable:
   - a) Temperature in Celsius  
   - b) Gender of students  
   - c) Grades (A, B, C, D, F)  
   - d) Number of mobile phones owned  
   - e) Time taken to complete a race  

2. Classify each as **Independent** or **Dependent**:
   - Amount of sleep vs. test performance  
   - Type of fertilizer vs. plant height
