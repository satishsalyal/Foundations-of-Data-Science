# 🌐 Facets of Data

A very large amount of data is generated in **Big Data** and **Data Science**. These data are of various types, and the main categories of data are as follows:

- 📊 **Structured**
- 📝 **Natural Language**
- 🔗 **Graph-based**
- ⚡ **Streaming**
- 📂 **Unstructured**
- 🤖 **Machine-generated**
- 🎥 **Audio, Video, and Images**

<summary>📊 <strong>Structured Data</strong></summary>

- Structured data is arranged in rows and columns, making it easy for applications to retrieve and process.  
- Stored in **Database Management Systems (DBMS)** using a predefined schema.
- Searchable by data type and easily understood by both computers and humans.

**Examples:**
- Excel spreadsheets  
- Customer transaction records  
- Employee databases

<details>
<summary>📂 <strong>Unstructured Data</strong></summary>

- Does not follow a specified format; no rows and columns.
- Difficult to retrieve required information without specialized processing.
- Can be in forms like text, audio, video, and images.

**Characteristics:**
1. No structural restrictions  
2. Can be of any type  
3. No predefined formats or sequences  
4. Unpredictable in nature  

**Examples:**
- Emails  
- Social media posts  
- Images and videos from smartphones

<summary>📝 <strong>Natural Language</strong></summary>

- Special type of unstructured data that comes in human language (written or spoken).
- Requires **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to interpret meaning.
- Used in entity recognition, topic detection, summarization, and sentiment analysis.

**Processing Steps:**
- Speech recognition  
- Natural language understanding  
- Machine translation  

**Examples:**
- Chatbot interactions  
- Customer reviews  
- News articles

<details>
<summary>🤖 <strong>Machine-Generated Data</strong></summary>

- Created without human intervention — generated automatically by systems, devices, or sensors.
- Can be structured or unstructured.

**Sources:**
- Server logs  
- IoT devices  
- Network event logs  

**Examples:**
- Web server logs  
- Call detail records from telecom systems  
- Telemetry from connected vehicles

<details>
<summary>🔗 <strong>Graph-Based or Network Data</strong></summary>

- Represents relationships between entities using **nodes** and **edges**.
- Stored in **graph databases** (e.g., Neo4j) and queried with specialized languages like SPARQL.

**Applications:**
- Fraud detection  
- Social network analysis  
- Recommendation systems  

**Examples:**
- Facebook friend connections  
- Google Knowledge Graph  
- Supply chain relationship maps

<details>
<summary>🎥 <strong>Audio, Image, and Video</strong></summary>

- Multimedia data that is often large and heterogeneous.
- Requires computer vision, speech recognition, and video analytics.

**Challenges:**
- Large storage requirements  
- High processing complexity  
- Diverse formats (lossless, lossy, uncompressed)  

**Examples:**
- Security camera footage  
- Medical MRI scans  
- YouTube videos and podcasts  

</details>

<details>
<summary>⚡ <strong>Streaming Data</strong></summary>

- Continuously generated by many sources in small batches.
- Requires real-time or near-real-time processing.

**Sources:**
- Mobile/web application logs  
- Social media feeds  
- Financial transactions  

**Examples:**
- Twitter live stream data  
- Real-time stock market feeds  
- GPS tracking data from delivery vehicles
