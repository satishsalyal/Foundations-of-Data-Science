## 🧠 What are Scales of Measurement in Statistics?

When data is collected for a study, the next step is to analyze it — which depends on the **tools used for data collection**.  

For example:
- For **qualitative data**, we can use certain labels (**nominal scale**) from which respondents select options.  
- For **quantitative data**, **interval** and **ratio scales** can be used to represent data numerically.

### 🔹 Example
If we want to collect data on the type of cars people prefer:
> The scale may include categories like *electric cars*, *diesel cars*, *hybrid cars*, etc.  
> 👉 Hence, a **nominal scale** will be used.  

If we want to find out the **weight of people** in a town:
> A **ratio scale** is appropriate.

## ⚙️ What is a Scale?

A **scale** is a device or an object used to **measure or quantify** any event or another object.

## 📈 Levels of Measurement

There are **four different scales** of measurement.  
Each scale defines how data is categorized, ranked, or measured.

| **Type** | **Level** |
|-----------|------------|
| 1️⃣ | Nominal Scale |
| 2️⃣ | Ordinal Scale |
| 3️⃣ | Interval Scale |
| 4️⃣ | Ratio Scale |

# 🟩 Nominal Scale

A **nominal scale** is the **1st level** of measurement.  
Here, numbers serve as **“tags” or “labels”** to classify or identify objects.  
It deals with **non-numeric variables** or numbers without value.

### ✴️ Characteristics
- Classified into two or more **categories**.  
- **Qualitative** in nature — numbers only **identify**, not **quantify**.  
- The only permissible numeric operation is **counting**.

### 💡 Example
**Question:** What is your gender?  
- M — Male  
- F — Female  

> Here, *M* and *F* are just labels; they don’t have numeric meaning.

# 🟨 Ordinal Scale

The **ordinal scale** is the **2nd level** of measurement.  
It shows the **ordering and ranking** of data **without** defining the degree of variation between them.

> “Ordinal” represents **order**.

### ✴️ Characteristics
- Shows **relative ranking** of variables.  
- Identifies and describes **magnitude** of variables.  
- Provides both **nominal** and **ranking** information.  
- The **intervals** between values are **unknown**.  
- Useful for analyzing **agreement levels** or **preferences**.

### 💡 Examples
- Ranking of students — *1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.*  
- Restaurant ratings — ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆  
- Frequency of occurrences:
  - Very often  
  - Often  
  - Not often  
  - Not at all  
- Degree of agreement:
  - Totally agree  
  - Agree  
  - Neutral  
  - Disagree  
  - Totally disagree

# 🟦 Interval Scale

The **interval scale** is the **3rd level** of measurement.  
It’s a **quantitative scale** where the **difference between values is meaningful**.  
However, **zero is arbitrary** (does not indicate absence).

### ✴️ Characteristics
- Quantifies **difference** between values.  
- Allows calculation of **mean** and **median**.  
- Supports **addition** and **subtraction** operations.  
- Suitable for measuring **feelings**, **calendar years**, etc.  

### 💡 Examples
- **Likert Scale** (e.g., satisfaction ratings)  
- **Net Promoter Score (NPS)**  
- **Bipolar Matrix Table**  
- **Temperature** in Celsius or Fahrenheit  

---

# 🟧 Ratio Scale

The **ratio scale** is the **4th and highest level** of measurement.  
It is **quantitative** and allows comparison of **differences and ratios**.  
The key feature is the presence of an **absolute zero**.

### ✴️ Characteristics
- Has a **true zero point** (indicates absence).  
- **No negative numbers** (zero means none).  
- Allows all **arithmetic operations** (+, –, ×, ÷).  
- Supports calculation of **mean**, **median**, and **mode**.  
- Enables **unit conversions** (e.g., kg → g, calories → joules).

### 💡 Example
**Question:** What is your weight in Kgs?
- Less than 55 kgs  
- 55 – 75 kgs  
- 76 – 85 kgs  
- 86 – 95 kgs  
- More than 95 kgs

## 🧾 Comparison Table of Measurement Scales

| **Scale** | **Properties** | **Examples** | **Allowable Math Operations** |
|------------|----------------|---------------|-------------------------------|
| **Nominal** | Categorizes data into distinct groups with **no order**. | Gender, eye color, political party, job titles, yes/no responses. | Counting, mode. |
| **Ordinal** | Categorizes and ranks data, but **intervals are not measurable**. | Education level, satisfaction ratings, race positions. | Counting, ranking, median, mode, percentiles. |
| **Interval** | Equal and meaningful intervals, but **no true zero**. | Temperature (°C/°F), calendar years, IQ scores. | Addition, subtraction, mean, standard deviation, correlation. |
| **Ratio** | Equal intervals **with a true zero point**. | Height, weight, age, time, income. | All arithmetic operations (+, –, ×, ÷), mean, median, mode, standard deviation, ratios. |

## 🎯 Summary

| **Scale** | **Type** | **Zero Point** | **Example** |
|------------|-----------|----------------|--------------|
| Nominal | Qualitative | None | Gender |
| Ordinal | Qualitative | None | Rank |
| Interval | Quantitative | Arbitrary | Temperature |
| Ratio | Quantitative | True Zero | Weight |

> 💬 **Key Insight:**  
> As we move from **nominal → ordinal → interval → ratio**,  
> the **amount of information** and **statistical power** increases.
