## What Is Data Science Used For?

Data science helps organizations analyze data in four main ways:

### 1. Descriptive Analysis
Focuses on understanding *what happened* or *what is happening* in a given data environment. It often uses visual tools such as pie charts, bar graphs, line charts, tables, and generated summaries.  
**Example:** A flight booking service might track the number of tickets sold each day. Descriptive analysis could reveal seasonal booking spikes, slumps, and high-performing months.

### 2. Diagnostic Analysis
Digs deeper to uncover *why* something happened. It uses techniques like drill-down, data discovery, data mining, and correlation analysis.  
**Example:** If the flight service experienced a spike in bookings one month, diagnostic analysis might reveal that many travelers were visiting a city for a major sporting event.

### 3. Predictive Analysis
Uses historical data to forecast future trends. Techniques include machine learning, forecasting, pattern matching, and predictive modeling. Computers learn from past patterns to anticipate future events.  
**Example:** The flight service could use predictive models to forecast next year’s booking trends. If the model predicts high demand for certain destinations in May, the company could launch targeted ad campaigns in February.

### 4. Prescriptive Analysis
Goes a step further—recommending the *best* course of action based on predicted outcomes. It leverages tools like graph analysis, simulations, neural networks, and recommendation engines.  
**Example:** To prepare for a predicted booking spike, prescriptive analysis might evaluate different marketing budgets and channels to determine the most effective campaign strategy, giving the company greater confidence in its decisions.
