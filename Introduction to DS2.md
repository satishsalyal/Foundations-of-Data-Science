# Data Science Use Case Prompts

## Original Prompt

```
What is data science used for? Data science is used to study data in four main ways:
1. Descriptive analysis
Descriptive analysis examines data to gain insights into what happened or what is happening in the data environment. It is characterized by data visualizations such as pie charts, bar charts, line graphs, tables, or generated narratives. For example, a flight booking service may record data like the number of tickets booked each day. Descriptive analysis will reveal booking spikes, booking slumps, and high-performing months for this service.

2. Diagnostic analysis
Diagnostic analysis is a deep-dive or detailed data examination to understand why something happened. It is characterized by techniques such as drill-down, data discovery, data mining, and correlations. Multiple data operations and transformations may be performed on a given data set to discover unique patterns in each of these techniques. For example, the flight service might drill down on a particularly high-performing month to better understand the booking spike. This may lead to the discovery that many customers visit a particular city to attend a monthly sporting event.

3. Predictive analysis
Predictive analysis uses historical data to make accurate forecasts about data patterns that may occur in the future. It is characterized by techniques such as machine learning, forecasting, pattern matching, and predictive modeling. In each of these techniques, computers are trained to reverse engineer causality connections in the data. For example, the flight service team might use data science to predict flight booking patterns for the coming year at the start of each year. The computer program or algorithm may look at past data and predict booking spikes for certain destinations in May. Having anticipated their customer’s future travel requirements, the company could start targeted advertising for those cities from February.

4. Prescriptive analysis
Prescriptive analytics takes predictive data to the next level. It not only predicts what is likely to happen but also suggests an optimum response to that outcome. It can analyze the potential implications of different choices and recommend the best course of action. It uses graph analysis, simulation, complex event processing, neural networks, and recommendation engines from machine learning.
Back to the flight booking example, prescriptive analysis could look at historical marketing campaigns to maximize the advantage of the upcoming booking spike. A data scientist could project booking outcomes for different levels of marketing spend on various marketing channels. These data forecasts would give the flight booking company greater confidence in their marketing decisions.

## What Is Data Science Used For?

Data science helps organizations analyze data in four main ways:

### 1. Descriptive Analysis
Focuses on understanding *what happened* or *what is happening* in a given data environment. It often uses visual tools such as pie charts, bar graphs, line charts, tables, and generated summaries.  
**Example:** A flight booking service might track the number of tickets sold each day. Descriptive analysis could reveal seasonal booking spikes, slumps, and high-performing months.

### 2. Diagnostic Analysis
Digs deeper to uncover *why* something happened. It uses techniques like drill-down, data discovery, data mining, and correlation analysis.  
**Example:** If the flight service experienced a spike in bookings one month, diagnostic analysis might reveal that many travelers were visiting a city for a major sporting event.

### 3. Predictive Analysis
Uses historical data to forecast future trends. Techniques include machine learning, forecasting, pattern matching, and predictive modeling. Computers learn from past patterns to anticipate future events.  
**Example:** The flight service could use predictive models to forecast next year’s booking trends. If the model predicts high demand for certain destinations in May, the company could launch targeted ad campaigns in February.

### 4. Prescriptive Analysis
Goes a step further—recommending the *best* course of action based on predicted outcomes. It leverages tools like graph analysis, simulations, neural networks, and recommendation engines.  
**Example:** To prepare for a predicted booking spike, prescriptive analysis might evaluate different marketing budgets and channels to determine the most effective campaign strategy, giving the company greater confidence in its decisions.
