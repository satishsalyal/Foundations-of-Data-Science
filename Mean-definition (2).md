# ✨ **Definition of Mean**

Mean (also called **Arithmetic Mean**) refers to the **average** value of a data set.  
It is defined as the **sum of all data values divided by the total number of values** in the set.

> 🧮 **Formula:**  
> **Mean = (Sum of Observations) / (Total Number of Observations)**

In contrast:
- **Median** → Middle value of the ordered data set  
- **Mode** → Most frequently occurring value

## 🚀 **How to Find Mean**

To calculate the mean value of the given data, follow these two simple steps:

1️⃣ **Add** all the values in the data set  
2️⃣ **Divide** the sum by the total number of data values  

---

## 📘 **Mean Formula**

According to the definition of mean, the formula is:

```math
Mean (x̄) = (Σ Xi) / N
```

Where:
- **N** → Total number of given data  
- **Σ Xi** → Sum of all data values

## 🌈 **Types of Mean**

There are three main types of mean in statistics:

| Type | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **Arithmetic Mean (AM)** | Simple average of all values |
| **Geometric Mean (GM)** | Mean based on product of values |
| **Harmonic Mean (HM)** | Mean based on reciprocals of values |

---

## 🧠 **Example 1: Mean for a Simple Data Set**

**Question:**  
Find the mean for the data set:  
`2, 6, 4, 5, 8`

**Solution:**

```math
Mean = (2 + 6 + 4 + 5 + 8) / 5  
     = 25 / 5  
     = 5
```

✅ **Mean = 5**

## 📊 **Mean for Ungrouped Data**

**Example:**  
A class of 20 students scored the following percentages:  

> 88, 82, 88, 85, 84, 80, 81, 82, 83, 85, 84, 74, 75, 76, 89, 90, 89, 80, 82, 83

**Find the mean percentage.**

**Solution:**

```math
Mean = (Sum of all percentages) / (Number of students)
     = 1660 / 20
     = 83
```

🎯 **Hence, the mean percentage = 83%**

## 📈 **Mean for Grouped Data**

We can find the mean using one of the following methods:

### 📍 **1. Direct Method**

```math
Mean = Σ(fixi) / Σ(fi)
```

### 📍 **2. Assumed Mean Method**

```math
Mean = A + (Σ(fi * di)) / Σ(fi)
```

### 📍 **3. Step-Deviation Method**

```math
Mean = A + [(Σ(fi * ui)) / Σ(fi)] * h
```

---

### 🧩 **Example (Grouped Data)**

| xi | 11 | 14 | 17 | 20 |
|----|----|----|----|----|
| fi | 3  | 6  | 8  | 7  |

| xi | fi | fixi |
|----|----|------|
| 11 | 3  | 33   |
| 14 | 6  | 84   |
| 17 | 8  | 136  |
| 20 | 7  | 140  |
| **Σfi = 24** | **Σfixi = 393** |   |

```math
Mean = Σfixi / Σfi  
     = 393 / 24  
     = 16.4
```

✅ **Mean = 16.4**

## 🔢 **Detailed Types of Mean**

### ⚡ Arithmetic Mean

When you **add all the values** and **divide by the total count**, you get the arithmetic mean.

**Example:**

Find the mean of `3, 5, 9, 5, 7, 2`

```math
Mean = (3 + 5 + 9 + 5 + 7 + 2) / 6  
     = 31 / 6  
     = 5.16
```

✨ **Answer: 5.16**

---

### 🌿 Geometric Mean

For two numbers **x** and **y**:

```math
GM = √(x * y)
```

For three numbers **x**, **y**, **z**:

```math
GM = ³√(x * y * z)
```

**Example:**  
Find the geometric mean of 4 and 3.

```math
GM = √(4 × 3) = √12 = 3.46
```

✅ **Geometric Mean = 3.46**

---

### 💧 Harmonic Mean

Harmonic mean is used when averaging **ratios or rates**.

For two numbers **x**, **y**:

```math
HM = 2xy / (x + y)
```

For three numbers **x**, **y**, **z**:

```math
HM = 3xyz / (xy + xz + yz)
```

🧩 The harmonic mean gives more weight to smaller values, making it useful for speed, density, and efficiency data.

## 🏁 **Summary**

| Type | Formula | Use Case |
|------|----------|-----------|
| **Arithmetic Mean** | (Σx) / n | General average |
| **Geometric Mean** | (Πx)^(1/n) | Growth rates, percentages |
| **Harmonic Mean** | n / (Σ(1/x)) | Rates and ratios |

> Arithmetic Mean is the most common and easiest to compute,  
> but in real-world applications, *choosing the correct type of mean*
