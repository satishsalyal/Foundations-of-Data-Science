# 📊 Statistics in Data Science

> **Statistics** is the science of **collecting, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting data** to uncover meaningful patterns and make informed decisions.  
> In **Data Science**, statistics serves as the **backbone** for understanding data, validating models, and making reliable predictions.

## 🌟 Importance of Statistics in Data Science

1. **Summarizing Data:**  
   Describes data using measures like **mean**, **median**, and **variance**.

2. **Modeling Uncertainty:**  
   Uses **probability** and **distributions** to handle uncertainty and quantify risk.

3. **Hypothesis Testing:**  
   Tests assumptions (e.g., **A/B testing**) to validate results.

4. **Identifying Relationships:**  
   Finds relationships between variables using **correlation** and **regression**.

# ⚖️ Measures of Central Tendency

> These measures describe the **center** or **typical value** of a dataset.  
> The three main measures are **Mean**, **Median**, and **Mode**.

---

## 🧮 1. Mean (Arithmetic Average)

**Definition:**  
The mean is the sum of all data values divided by the total number of values.

\[
\text{Mean } (\mu) = \frac{\sum X}{n}
\]

**Example:**
```text
Data: 10, 15, 20, 25, 30  
Mean = (10 + 15 + 20 + 25 + 30) / 5 = 20
```

**Key Points:**
- Represents the average value.
- Sensitive to **outliers**.
- Commonly used for **average income, temperature, or marks**.

---

## ⚖️ 2. Median

**Definition:**  
The **median** is the middle value when data is sorted in ascending or descending order.

- **Odd number of values:** Middle value  
- **Even number of values:** Average of two middle values  

**Examples:**
```text
Odd Data: 12, 14, 18, 20, 22 → Median = 18  
Even Data: 10, 20, 30, 40 → Median = (20 + 30)/2 = 25
```

**Key Points:**
- Not affected by **extreme values**.
- Ideal for **skewed datasets** (e.g., income, property prices).

---

## 🔁 3. Mode

**Definition:**  
The **mode** is the most frequently occurring value in a dataset.

**Example:**
```text
Data: 4, 5, 6, 6, 7, 8, 9 → Mode = 6
```

**Key Points:**
- Can be **no mode**, **bimodal**, or **multimodal**.  
- Useful for **categorical data** (e.g., most sold product, favorite subject).

---

# 🌈 Measures of Dispersion

> While central tendency tells us where data centers, **dispersion** tells us how much it **varies** or **spreads out**.

---

## 📏 1. Range

**Definition:**  
Difference between the **maximum** and **minimum** values.

\[
\text{Range} = \text{Max} - \text{Min}
\]

**Example:**
```text
Data: 10, 12, 18, 20, 25 → Range = 25 - 10 = 15
```

⚠️ *Highly affected by outliers.*

---

## 🔢 2. Variance (σ²)

**Definition:**  
Variance measures how far each value is from the mean — it’s the **average squared deviation**.

\[
σ^2 = \frac{\sum (X - \mu)^2}{n}
\]

**Example:**
```text
Data: 2, 4, 6  
Mean = 4  
Variance = [(2−4)² + (4−4)² + (6−4)²] / 3 = 2.67
```

📖 *Higher variance = greater spread of data.*

---

## 📉 3. Standard Deviation (σ)

**Definition:**  
Square root of variance — indicates the **average distance** of data points from the mean.

\[
σ = \sqrt{\frac{\sum (X - \mu)^2}{n}}
\]

**Example:**
```text
From the previous example:  
σ = √2.67 ≈ 1.63
```

✅ *Widely used in finance, education, and research.*

---

## 📊 4. Interquartile Range (IQR)

**Definition:**  
The range of the **middle 50%** of data. Less sensitive to extreme values.

\[
\text{IQR} = Q3 - Q1
\]

**Steps:**
1. Sort data.  
2. Find Q1 (25th percentile).  
3. Find Q3 (75th percentile).  
4. Subtract Q1 from Q3.

**Example:**
```text
Data: 5, 7, 8, 12, 13, 14, 18, 21, 23  
Q1 = 8, Q3 = 18  
IQR = 18 − 8 = 10
```

---

## 🧭 5. Quartiles

| Quartile | Meaning | Percentile |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| Q1 | Median of lower half | 25th |
| Q2 | Median of full dataset | 50th |
| Q3 | Median of upper half | 75th |

**Example:**  
If student scores are sorted,  
Q1 = score below which 25% of students scored.

---

## 📐 6. Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD)

**Definition:**  
Average of the absolute deviations from the mean.

\[
\text{MAD} = \frac{\sum |X - \mu|}{n}
\]

**Example:**
```text
Data: 3, 6, 9  
Mean = 6  
MAD = (|3−6| + |6−6| + |9−6|)/3 = 2
```

💡 *Easier to interpret than variance and less affected by extreme values.*

### 🎯 Key Takeaway

> 📌 **Central tendency** gives you the *typical value*,  
> while **dispersion** tells you how *consistent or variable* your data is.  
> Together, they form the foundation of **descriptive statistics** — a core skill in data science.

**💻 Next Step:**  
Want to visualize these concepts?  
Try plotting them in Python using libraries like **NumPy**, **Pandas**, and **Matplotlib** to see how data distribution affects these measures.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

data = [10, 15, 20, 25, 30]
print("Mean:", np.mean(data))
print("Median:", np.median(data))
print("Mode:", pd.Series(data).mode()[0])
plt.hist(data, bins=5, color='skyblue', edgecolor='black')
plt.title("Data Distribution")
plt.xlabel("Values")
plt.ylabel("Frequency")
plt.show()
```
